Here you can find the HTML output produced by my .rmd file, which is on my portfolio. There is also the code of my Rshiny application including Ui.R and server.R

# Packages used
I used **Rshiny** and **Rshiny Dashboard** to produce the benchmark appliation. Moreover, I also used packages such as **diplyr**, **rvest** or **tydyverse** for data handling. Finaly, I chose **ggplot2** and **plotly** for display results
