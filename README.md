# Content
Here you can find the HTML output produced by my .rmd file, which is on my portfolio. There is also the code of my Rshiny application including ui.R and server.R.

# Rshiny application execution
Please load ui.r and server.r files first on your Rstudio IDE. Then click on the green arrow to run the app.   
**Note :** I Invite you to extend the window size of aplication, in order to display the unit's statistics that are hidden on the nativ window size.

# Packages used
I used **Rshiny** and **Rshiny Dashboard** to produce the benchmark appliation. Moreover, I also used packages such as **diplyr**, **rvest** or **tydyverse** for data handling. Finaly, I chose **ggplot2** and **plotly** for display results.

# Remerciements
Thank you to Philippe Zhang, also studant in artificial intelligence, who helped me to produce this document.
